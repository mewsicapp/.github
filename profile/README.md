# mewsic - a better music client

## What is mewsic?
mewsic (if you capitalize it i will be sad but wont stop you) is a universally cross-platform music client
that is designed to be as feature-rich and extendable as possible.

## Why?
no reason. no reason at all. 

## What services does mewsic pull from?
mewsic pulls from Youtube and Soundcloud (WIP) for video/audio content,
and can pull from not only those but also Spotify (WIP), Deezer (WIP), and Tidal (WIP)
to import playlists and liked songs.

## What do you mean by "universally"?
mewsic builds to native via Kotlin build targets on platforms such as:
- Android 
- iOS 
- Windows 
- Linux 
- macOS 
- Web*

*Web is likely not actually possible due to CORS restrictions, but it is a hope.

## What features does mewsic have?
mewsic has a lot of features, but the most important ones are:
- Playlist and Liked Song sync from other platforms
- last.fm integration 
- Theme support (WIP)
- Plugin support (WIP)
- Multi-Platform search
- Playlists containing content from multiple sources
